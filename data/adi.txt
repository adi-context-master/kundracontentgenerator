## About
After a decade in tech - from LinkedIn to WeWork to Qonto - I left to build something that matters deeply to me.

What sparked it? A book my aunt wrote in 1998 about gender equality at work. Nearly 30 years later, I was shocked by how many of the same barriers remained. Especially around parental leave: careers stalled, top performers left, and teams paid the price.

So I built Kundra: a platform that makes parental leave predictable, structured, and ROI-positive.

Kundra gives employees, managers, and HR a single timeline, clear handovers, and data to track return-to-performance. No more guessing. No more lost talent.

🛠️ With the product, we’re co-building a new standard for leave with forward-thinking companies.
🎙️ On the Kundra Podcast, I share stories from top performers and leaders.
📩 In Kundra Notes, I distill insights for companies who want to lead.

If you’re building for performance, retention, and equality: let’s connect.

📸 2014: I got my first company t-shirt at LinkedIn.
I remember thinking… why do people get so excited about swag?

Fast-forward to today - wearing our own Kundra Crew shirt that says 
“𝗪𝗲 𝗸𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗿𝘂𝗻𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗲𝗻𝘀.”
 
And now, I understand - it’s not about the t-shirt. It’s about the mission - a small reminder that you’re part of something bigger than yourself.

As a mission-led founder, that’s what I want our team (and everyone we work with) to feel: connected, purposeful, and proud of what we’re building 💚 

Thank you to everyone helping make Kundra real, one step at a time.

✨ Curious - what’s the brand you’ve felt personally connected to, and why?

If you listen to Marine on the podcast you can hear it in her voice: the motivation, the passion and loyalty for Alan thanks to having been looked after during her maternity leave ✨ 

“𝗛𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗹𝘆, 𝗶𝘁’𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗳𝗹𝘆𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗲𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲.” - 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗲

That’s not just the case for most unfortunately: at our breakfast event we heard that 72% of senior women in France said their return from maternity leave was extremely difficult - and the struggle to balance work and life jumps above 80% for parents with very young children.

💡 I am curious: why do you think not more companies treat this like the high-leverage, revenue-protecting move it is?

Yesterday, we hosted our first Kundra Breakfast - a morning to talk 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲.

It was honest, raw, and a reminder of why this topic still feels taboo: because it’s seen as “personal”, when in reality it shapes the professional - how people show up, grow, and stay.

From Didier’s simple truth - “𝘪𝘧 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘥 𝘸𝘦𝘭𝘭, 𝘱𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘥𝘰𝘯’𝘵 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬” 

- to Louise’s sharp observation that “𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘰𝘮𝘦𝘯 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘭𝘥𝘳𝘦𝘯 𝘭𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘪𝘳 𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘳𝘴, 𝘩𝘰𝘭𝘥 𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘧𝘶𝘭 𝘳𝘰𝘭𝘦𝘴, 𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘢𝘯𝘪𝘦𝘴 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘺 𝘥𝘰𝘯’𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘤𝘩𝘰𝘪𝘤𝘦 𝘢𝘯𝘺𝘮𝘰𝘳𝘦 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘮𝘢𝘯𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘸𝘦𝘭𝘭”…

→ the message was clear: 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗻𝗼 𝗹𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗮 “𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲.”

We explored what it really takes for organizations to support parents and performance.
Themes that kept coming up:
- how parenthood sharpens, not slows, performance
- why good intentions aren’t enough without process
- and how culture, not policy, defines the experience.

A huge thank you to our amazing speakers -
 💬 Didier Hilhorst, VP Design, Qonto
 💬 Louise Lachaize, Head of People Yousign
 💬 Rita B., Founder EmpowerMum
 - for making space for a topic that’s still too often unspoken, yet touches so many of us.

💡 Why do you think parenthood at work is still so under-addressed?
 And do you believe the themes above could help us move toward a brighter future?
