## About
I'm exploring new ways to reconnect parents and children.

After 10 years growing brands and products within high-growth companies, I decided to build my own, driven by the desire to have a tangible impact on families' lives.

I enjoy connecting with entrepreneurs, parents, and anyone with a curious mind.

Get in touch if you think our paths should cross!

I'm so happy to announce that there are now two of us on this adventure! 🤝

Two months ago, I met Arnaud.

Arnaud is the father of two little boys, and he shares the same aspirations as me:

👉 To challenge the status quo surrounding parenting
👉 To rebuild the parent/child bond through play
👉 To build a project with impact

And then, I (also!) immediately saw how well our profiles complemented each other 🙌

We weren't sure.

So we said to ourselves: "Let's give it a try?"

The result?

After two months of working hand in hand, we realize that we're a perfect match.

Welcome to the adventure, Arnaud de Miscault.

And thank you for saying yes to this incredibly exciting endeavor. 🚀

The 3 pieces of advice (and their opposites) I've received most often since I started 👇

"Just go for it, even if it's imperfect."

"Wait until you have something really high-quality."

"Partner with someone."

"Stay solo as long as possible."

"You're crazy to do this with young children."

"Go for it, it's the perfect time."

My belief: move forward, test, make mistakes, learn.

That's exactly what I've decided to do on December 13th and 14th,
by organizing my first parent/child pilot in the heart of the Batignolles district.

(If I had listened to some of these people, I never would have done it 😉)

Don't get me wrong: I do take feedback (you just have to know how to filter it)!

Write to me if you think our paths should cross.

I thought I was a model of good screen time. 😇
Until my 2.5-year-old daughter unwittingly put me in my place.

Two days ago, we were doing a puzzle together. Then I took my phone out of my pocket to reply to a message.

A completely harmless gesture... for me.

But not for her.

At just two and a half years old, she looked at me with a little pout and said, in a voice that was sad, serious, and insistent all at once:

"Mommy, phone in your pocket."

It left me speechless.

Me, who always thought I was a model of good screen time! And yet, it was she, little as she is, who reminded me what it means to "be present."

At that moment, I understood that children can also alert us, in their own way. They become our mirrors, true mediators, unwittingly revealing our own flaws.

It was a real wake-up call.

Now, if I decide to spend time with her, I want to give it my all. Not halfway.

And she senses it, believe me.
