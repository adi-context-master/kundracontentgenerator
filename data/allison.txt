## About
My entire adult life I’ve been hyper focused on my career - both ensuring that my current role is an exciting challenge, and that I’m on a path forward. 

I got pregnant in 2017 with my first child and nearly quit a sales leadership role I loved - all because of the disruption my 3-month maternity leave caused. 

It became obvious to me that there is a huge gap in how companies support working parents before, during and after parental leave without impacting their career trajectory.

I turned that realization into an opportunity to help other working parents avoid the issues I ran into, which brought me to where I am today: co-founder and CEO of Parentaly.

Here’s the story about how … and why … I started Parentaly 

🤰🏼 It’s 2017, and after 10 years of working in banking and PE and getting my MBA, I’m now leading the enterprise sales team for a VC-backed startup … and that’s when I found out I was (finally!) pregnant 

I was thrilled! I wanted to be a mother my whole life, my company offered great medical benefits and I had access to a 12 week paid parental leave

My parental leave was wonderful, hard, inspiring and life-changing 

😡 But the return-to-work process was an absolute nightmare. My direct reports had struggled while I was out, key deliverables slipped through the cracks, we missed our goals, and a direct report even quit because of her experience

So what did I do? I honestly considered quitting - not to drop out of the workforce, but to take a similar role at a similar company…. because the idea of starting fresh elsewhere felt easier than digging out from the hole my parental leave had created

💡 But I didn’t quit! And somewhere in that messy middle I had the epiphany…

Companies are offering paid parental leave to support and retain parents - and yet, the time away is having the OPPOSITE impact! It’s actually creating big problems for parents’ careers and their teams and the business results 

I knew there HAD to be a better way ... enter Parentaly

We partner with HR leaders to offer career coaching to thousands of employees every year - helping them build strong coverage plans, enter parental leave with confidence, and return to work stronger than ever

We also train managers on how to support expecting and new parents (and the business) through parental leave

🌟 And we’re proving that parental leave doesn’t need to be a stressful, disruptive experience … it can actually be fantastic for everyone

Parentaly is fully booked for new client launches until March.

For the first time ever, we're onboarding so many companies that we had to enact a 3-month waitlist 🤯

Yes, this is a big milestone for Parentaly - 

But it’s an even bigger milestone for the market.

Because it shows how many companies are finally getting it:

Strong parental leave policies are important ...

But so is how you support those policies:
✅ You need coverage planning
✅ You need reonboarding
✅ You need manager training
✅ You need real systems to ensure things don’t fall apart when your top talent is out for 3-6 months

For five years, I spent most of my time making the case for this.

Now? I spend virtually ALL my time implementing these solutions.

And that feels pretty amazing.

If this type of work is inspiring to you, stay tuned! 

Because soon we’ll be hiring to help us support these new clients 🥳

What if asking for better parental leave support was... ridiculously easy?

That question has been on our mind for a while.

Because most people do want to advocate ... for:
 ✅ The next round of new parents
 ✅ The coworkers covering during leave
 ✅ Themselves, the next time around

At Parentaly, we offer full support: coverage planning, manager training, re-onboarding. 

We sell to companies ... but often, it’s parents and managers who start the conversation.

Because when employees ask for this support, companies listen.

So we built something to make that easier:

A one-stop hub with the language, templates, and tools to help you advocate for Parentaly at your company.

Whether you're a new parent, a manager, or in HR - this is for you.

Today, I get to share something I’ve dreamed about for years:

Parentaly has formed a new CHRO Advisory Board, and it includes some of the most iconic and thoughtful HR leaders in the world.

These are executives who have led people strategy at companies like Mastercard, MetLife, WeightWatchers, Xerox, Morningstar, Proofpoint and more. 

They’ve navigated downturns, scaled cultures, and built organizations where people-centered strategy drives business results.

And now? They’re backing Parentaly.

Not just in principle - but with their time, insight and conviction.

As a founder, this moment is emotional. 

Because while we’ve already proven our impact over the last six years across thousands of employees and their managers - this milestone signals something bigger:

Parental leave transitions are NOT niche.

They are high-stakes, high-impact, and worthy of C-level attention from the biggest and best companies in the world. 

When handled poorly, parental leave derails careers, burns out teams, and quietly damages business continuity.

But when done right? It builds trust, retains top talent, and strengthens leadership pipelines.

To our new CHRO advisors: thank you.

You are helping us redefine how companies manage leave - so both people and the business can thrive.
