# Rita's LinkedIn Profile

## About
I'm Rita,
a former executive manager in finance and consulting who had two children while working as an employee.
I started my own business two years ago to offer concrete solutions and make a difference in the areas of career and parenting. 

◉ In two years, I have:
- Supported more than 10 companies and over a hundred employees
- Hosted several online and in-person conferences on work-life balance, mental load, and returning from maternity/parental leave
- Compiled a report on the application of professional coaching during the period of returning from maternity leave

◉ I have tested what I apply, and my clients have approved it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

➡️The arrival of a child is a life transition, as are the different stages of parenthood
➡️Returning to work and managing your career during these life events is just as much of a transition: it requires preparation, anticipation, and gentle support, but also movement and action. 
➡️Parenting takes different forms and at each stage it represents a challenge for employees and the company
➡️It's a team effort 🤝 Company, HR, managers, parents
➡️The impacts are numerous: work-life balance, mental load, confidence and self-esteem, managing emotions and stress, career development.


◉ My mission?
That maternity and parenthood are no longer obstacles to career growth and performance, but instead become strengths that help people thrive, shine, and reach collective goals.

◉ How do I do this?

I support transition periods (departures/returns from leave, challenges of parenthood).

I help women manage their careers with confidence and align their choices with their ambitions.

I organise workshops and talks dedicated to mothers and/or working parents.

I guide managers and HR teams on the best practices to adopt.

◉ 💥 My flagship offer: the Parents@work programme

Support and empower your female employees, improve their work–life balance, and increase their motivation and performance.

Strengthen your employer brand, meet certain CSR criteria, and attract female talent.

Promote equity, women’s career development, and role models to inspire current and future generations.

That’s (almost) everything!
You can book a meeting directly from my profile or send me a message to discuss your challenges and projects.

See you soon 👋

I realised something that almost no one says out loud.
Women support each other much more when they’re building their own business than when they’re employees.

Why?
Because in entrepreneurship:

You choose the people around you

You know it’s tough, so helping each other comes naturally

We all want to “make it past the 3-year mark”, so we re-motivate each other when morale is low

Every introduction can literally change your year

Sharing a best practice costs you nothing and can bring huge value to the other person (and to you later)

The result:
More motivation, more opportunities, and a network that keeps growing!

So why does this reflex disappear in many companies?

Annual promotions are sometimes limited: “only one woman at the table”

In meetings, the rule is often “take the space”: it’s a race for visibility

Lack of confidence leads some women to put others down instead of lifting them up

Money remains a taboo topic (salaries, bonuses…)

Fortunately, it’s not like this everywhere, and many companies do have internal networks!
Support does exist, and we always observe the same effects:

↗️ Collective performance: information circulates faster, ideas flow
↗️ Engagement & retention: you rarely leave a team where you feel supported
↗️ Employer branding: a positive approach with real impact
↗️ Less turnover after maternity leave
↗️ More women reaching key positions (and faster)
And as a bonus: it benefits everyone.

Today I want to challenge you — whether you're an employee or an entrepreneur:
Which woman are you going to connect to another woman to start changing the game?

PS: If you need a boost to set this up in your company, I have plenty of zero-budget ideas. My LinkedIn messages are open!

Talking about parenthood is good.
Turning it into a business lever is even better 🔽

Yesterday morning, we discussed this topic with Theresa Gschwandtner, Didier Hilhorst and Louise Lachaize — four committed voices with one shared view:
Parenthood is a strategic priority.

Because behind the words, there is a real business reality.
Because an inclusive policy also ensures business continuity and team performance.
And because companies that take the topic seriously are already seeing the impact:

Less turnover

Higher engagement

More career progression for women

When we know that over 80% of female managers struggle to balance work and personal life when they have children aged 0 to 3,
Supporting parenthood becomes a concrete way to act — and accelerate professional equality (👋 hashtag#loiRixain).

So that talent stays.
So that they — and especially women — can grow within the company!

Thank you all for the rich and authentic exchanges.

Sustainable performance also depends on how we support key life moments.

How to maintain performance and business continuity when a female employee goes on (and returns from) maternity leave
